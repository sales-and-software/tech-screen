Interview question for the technical screen step of the hiring funnel.

## Full Stack
"Endpoint A1" returns a list of products. Your task is to build out a REST endpoint that provides Search and Filter functionality over the product info. 

We expect to see API support for these query parameters:

```
search
minPrice
maxPrice
minReviewRating
maxReviewRating
minReviewCount
maxReviewCount
inStock
```

The clients of this API should be able to provide any combination of these parameters and get the products matching all the specified criteria.

* __The final submission is a link to a new, organized repo that you create and establish with best practices.__
* Set your standards for clean code, unit testing, documentation, clear commit messages, etc. 
* Bonus points for considering trade-offs like performance, timeline, etc.
